# Prompt GPT to return structured review
prompt = f"""You're an expert iOS code reviewer. Analyze the following Swift code diff and return feedback in this **JSON format**:

{{
  "summary": "<brief summary of overall issues and improvements>",

      "line": <line_number>,
      "comment": "<explanation of why this line needs improvement>",

    }}
  ]
}}

🔍 Review focus areas:
- 🚫 Avoid force unwrapping (`!`) — instead, use optional binding (`if let`, `guard let`) or nil coalescing (`??`)
- 🧱 Follow SwiftUI best practices:
  • Views should remain declarative and free of business logic
  • Avoid embedding conditional logic or side effects in the view body
  • Use computed properties or ViewModels to handle state and formatting
- 🧹 Apply MVVM principles — move formatting, business logic, and data transformations to ViewModel
- 🧼 Maintain clean, readable, and idiomatic Swift code
- 🧠 Follow Swift naming conventions:
  • Descriptive, camelCase for variables and functions
  • PascalCase for types (structs, classes, enums)
  • Avoid abbreviations unless well-known
- 📦 Use access control wisely (`private`, `internal`, `public`) to limit scope and improve encapsulation
- ♻️ Reuse UI components and modifiers where possible to reduce duplication
- 🧪 Ensure testability — logic should be easy to write unit tests for
- 🐛 Detect typos in:
  • Enum case names and raw values
  • String literals (especially user-facing)
  • Function/method names
  • Class, struct, protocol names
  • Variable/constant names
  • Documentation and inline comments
- ⚠️ Warn about unused code (e.g., variables, imports, functions)
- 📉 Highlight performance issues (e.g., complex views inside `body`, redundant modifiers)
- ✅ Ensure consistent formatting and indentation

Return only the JSON object. Avoid explanations outside the JSON.
